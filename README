This project is a nascent python module for tabletop rpg generation and statistical tools. 

rpg.py contains Character and Adventure classes for generating those, as well as utility functions to extract data from json, generate names from text strings, etc.

dnd.py contains dice-rolling utilities and D&D-specific character generation functions. gsys.py contains the same for Genesys, along with a simulation-based dice roll probability calculator. rpg.py and gsys.py both have a main input loop and can be run as contained programs.

Raw data for the rpg.py generators can be found in the tbls/ folder.
