# 1. Establish whether the campaign area
# is in the northern or southern hemisphere
# of the campaign world.
#
# 2. Establish what month it is by rolling
# 1d12 and referencing Table 1.
#
# 3. Establish the campaign area's terrain:
# broken land, desert, forest, grassland
# (includes clear), hills, jungle, mountains, or
# swamp.
#
# 4. Establish whether the type of terrain
# is inland or coastal.
#
# 5. Establish the latitude of the terrain
# (equator = 0° latitude; poles = 90° lati-
# tude). There are about 720 miles between
# each 10 degrees of latitude for Earthlike worlds.
#
# 6. Consult Table 2 to find the climatic
# type (listed as types A-L).
#
# 7. Consult the temperature tables (Tables
# 3-14) for average temperatures for that
# month. Most temperatures fall within the
# average range for the month; however,
# there is a 5% chance that it will be unusu-
# ally warm, and a 5% chance that it will be
# unusually cold that month. Also, make
# sure to note the possible temperature
# changes caused by nightfall, and by strong
# winds in cold regions.
#
# 8. Consult the day-by-day precipitation
# tables (Tables 15 and 16). Assuming that
# each month has 30 days, roll percentile
# dice 30 times, noting how many rainy/
# snowy days result. Rainy/snowy days may
# be scattered throughout the month or may
# be grouped together as a period of bad
# weather. If you wish to determine ran-
# domly when rainy days come, roll 1d30 to
# determine which days will have precipita-
# tion, ignoring any results already rolled. If
# almost every day of the month is rainy/
# snowy, roll to see which days are dry.
# If you choose to group the rainy/snowy
# days together, roll 1d30 to see on which
# day of the month the bad weather begins,
# If this roll produces weather that doesn't
# fit within the month  for example,
# eight days of rain starting on the 30th (or
# within the time period during which char-
# acters will be traveling through that ter-
# rain)  roll again until the bad weather
# fits within the month, or have the bad
# weather end on the last day of the month
# and extend backward from there.
#
# Construct a logical weather pattern
# for example, drizzle, broken clouds, and
# light winds on the first day or two, build-
# ing to moderate rain and wind, then heavy
# rain and wind, then back to drizzle again
# (see the next paragraph). To help charac-
# ters predict the weather, throw in a few
# cirrus (high wispy) clouds on the last sun-
# ny day to foreshadow the rain to come.
# Note that wind can occur without precipi-
# tation, but clear, windy days usually pre-
# cede bad weather. To determine the wind
# strength on a random windy day, roll 1d8
# and consult Table 18.
#
# Before determining a weather pattern,
# consult Table 16 to see how heavy this
# precipitation gets (at its worst). Even
# though the bad weather may span several
# days, it may never be any more t
