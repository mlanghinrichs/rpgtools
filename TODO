BEFORE v0.2:
/Eliminate .raw in goh.py
/Bring goh.py into rpg.py and generalize adventure generation
/Make optional namesource var in Character class to act as alternative to setting/race for name source
/Move generator files into one file or into nested folders; change code to reflect that - moved to json & changed code
/Convert goh's generator to use .json as well (should be easy once it's in rpg.py)
/Remove deprecated txt-file-generator-based code from rpg.py
/Properly comment rpg.py

BEFORE v0.3:
/Clean input loop in rpg.py
/Clean repetitive code in Adventure.__init__()
/Bugfix v0.2
Characteristic generators for:
    /dnd and
    gsys
/D&D roll statistics tools in dnd.py (-> mobile)
Skill generators for /dnd and gsys
Fill out name generator file more
/Create dnd.py for dnd-specific tools
/import dnd, gsys in rpg.py
Generalize gsys.py for genesys-specific tools (and ofc merge in gsys.py from mobile branch)
